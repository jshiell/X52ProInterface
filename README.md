X52ProInterface
===============

This is a partial interface via Java to the Saitek X52 Pro (primarily the MFD). If I get organised enough it'll probably get ported to Objective-C, so I can have an accurate clock when I'm in OS X.

At present you can use it to:

* Update the date & time values
* Write text to the MFD
